Dataset Description 
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. We'll be looking for ways to make correlations between certain variables given in an attempt to find ways to increase a movies revenue potential. While the original dataset contains many columns, we'll be removing many columns that are of no use to us. We'll be focused on the the following four columns.<br><br>

budget - How much money did it cost to make the movie.
revenue - How much money the movie made.
runtime -  The length of the movie in minutes.
vote_average - The average of the votes collected for the movie.

Questions for Analysis
1) Does the size of a movies budget correlate to more revenue generated by the movie?<br>
2) Does a higher vote average correlate to more revenue generated by the movie?
3) Does the movies runtime correlate to more revenue generated by the movie?
